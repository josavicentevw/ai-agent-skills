## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Team Member Underperforming

**Steps**:
1. **Investigate root causes** - Is it skills, motivation, personal issues, or unclear expectations?
2. **Have direct conversation** - Be specific about concerns
3. **Create improvement plan** - Set measurable goals with timeline (usually 30-60-90 days)
4. **Provide support** - Training, mentorship, reduced scope
5. **Monitor progress** - Weekly check-ins
6. **Make decision** - Continue, extend plan, or part ways

**Sample Conversation**:
```
"I want to talk about performance concerns I've observed. Over the last 2 months, 
you've missed 3 sprint commitments and the quality of your code has had more bugs 
than usual. Can you help me understand what's going on?"

[Listen to their perspective]

"Let's work together on a plan to get you back on track. Here's what I'm thinking..."
```

### Scenario 2: Two Engineers Not Collaborating

**Steps**:
1. Meet with each separately to understand their perspective
2. Identify the core issue (communication style, technical disagreement, personality clash)
3. Facilitate a conversation if both are willing
4. Set clear expectations for professional behavior
5. Monitor interactions and follow up

### Scenario 3: Engineer Wants to Switch Teams

**Steps**:
1. Understand their motivation (growth, interest, conflict?)
2. Discuss opportunities for growth in current team
3. If still interested, support their exploration
4. Facilitate conversations with other teams
5. Plan transition if move is approved
6. Maintain positive relationship
